# Multi-UAV-collision-avoidance
This project is part of summer research internship at IIIT Delhi
UAV’S have paved their way into different fields of applications like surveillance, communication. Multi-uav’s have great importance in such areas. Coordination of vehicles is one of the critical tasks under which path planning is looked upto. For this foremost condition is collision avoidance maneuver. Avoiding collision with static as well as dynamic objects. In this project we have worked on collision avoidance with different drone(dynamic obstacle).
